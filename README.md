Hello everyone! I'm **Siddhant Maurya**, graduated from CSJM Kanpur in a field of ECE in 2022. I believe that we must follow our interest and give 100% to it, in between of graduation , I'm more exicted when i done my summer internship. Somehow i get connected with coding and i put one step forward towards my interest after graduation.My activities always surprise me what i have done in past few months is a short story for others but not for me.
